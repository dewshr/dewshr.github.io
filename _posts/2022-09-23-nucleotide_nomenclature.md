Although DNA sequences are represented by four nucleotide bases `(A,T,G,C)` they can be represented by alternate letters based on different scenario. One of the example would be sequencing data, where `N` is used if nucleotide base can not be indentified for a particular position. It can also be used to represent motif sequences.

The picture below represents the alternate representation for possible nucleotide bases at given position. Image taken from [here](https://genomevolution.org/wiki/index.php/Ambiguous_nucleotide#:~:text=Ambiguous%20nucleotides%20are%20used%20when,which%20represents%20any%20possible%20nucleotide.).
